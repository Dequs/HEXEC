## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue and include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots or logs if applicable
- Information about your environment (OS, version, etc.)

Do **not** open duplicate issues. Check existing issues first.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. When submitting one:

- Clearly describe the feature
- Explain why it would be useful
- Provide examples or use cases if possible

Keep expectations realistic.

## Pull Requests

Before submitting a Pull Request:

2. Create a new branch for your change  
   `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes
4. Test your changes
5. Commit with clear, descriptive messages
6. Push to your fork
7. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch

### Pull Request Rules

- One feature or fix per Pull Request
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Follow the existing code style
- Do not include unrelated changes
- Explain **what** you changed and **why**

Pull Requests that are messy, unclear, or break existing functionality may be rejected.

## Code Style

- Keep code readable and clean
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Avoid unnecessary complexity

If the project uses linters or formatters, run them before submitting.

## Commit Messages

Write clear commit messages:

- Use present tense (e.g. `Add feature`, not `Added feature`)

- Add details in the body if needed

---

## Documentation

If you add or change functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

---

## Code of Conduct
